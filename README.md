# Peloton Strategy & Market Analysis Case Study

Strategic product and market analysis of Peloton focused on post-pandemic growth, customer retention, and rebranding opportunities. This project examines Peloton’s financial trajectory, competitive landscape, user behavior shifts, and proposes a hybrid product + subscription strategy to restore profitability and brand relevance.

## 🧩 Project Overview

Peloton experienced explosive growth during COVID-19, followed by steep post-pandemic decline driven by demand drop, excess inventory, product fatigue, and competition from lower-priced alternatives.  
This case study analyzes:

- What caused the demand crash after 2021  
- How Peloton's business model shifted from hardware-driven to subscription-driven  
- Why users churned despite strong community loyalty  
- Where new growth opportunities exist across digital, physical, and brand ecosystems  

The final output includes strategic recommendations across product, pricing, brand positioning, and go-to-market execution.

## 🔍 Key Insights

✅ Subscription revenue is more profitable than hardware sales → strategic shift to “software-led fitness” is required  
✅ Churn is driven less by pricing and more by **variety fatigue, lack of novelty, and missing in-person accountability**  
✅ Segment analysis shows **3 high-value clusters**: fitness enthusiasts, working parents, boutique studio users  
✅ Peloton still owns **strong brand equity**, but suffers from **relevance decay** — not awareness or quality issues  
✅ Competitors are winning on **price**, not **community or ecosystem** → Peloton still has differentiation runway
